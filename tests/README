## Testing Suppressions

The tests for suppressions follow these basic principles:

- The test suppression rules can be found in `fixtures/suppression.yaml`.
- Findings that should be matched against the suppression rules can be found in `fixtures/matching_findings.json`.
- Findings that should NOT be matched with any suppression rule can be found in `fixtures/non_matching_findings.json`.
- The expected match result between findings and rules can be found in `fixtures/expected_matched_findings.json`.
- The expected suppression requests sent to Security Hub can be found in `fixtures/expected_batch_update_findings.json`.
